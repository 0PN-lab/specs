**Historical Context**: This profile operationalizes **Council of Europe Convention 108+ transparency requirements** as digital public infrastructure for co-regulated transparency. Completes the **MVCR - Open Notice** purpose co-invented in 2013 by Phil Pearce and Reuben Binns, and formalized as the Minimum Viable Consent Receipt (MVCR v0.9) specification by the Kantara Initiative in 2015. The MVCR work was adopted as the foundation for ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 and referenced in ISO/IEC 29184:2020 Appendix D. Rather than creating a new code of conduct, this profile implements Convention 108+ Articles 5, 8, 9, 10, and 14 as operational transparency infrastructure supporting all six legal bases through bilateral notice receipts, public Controller Identification Records, and Notice Event Logs.

**Acknowledgments**: This profile builds upon the foundational **MVCR - Open Notice** architecture co-invented with Valentino Spataro, Phil Pearce and Reuben Binns (2013), facilitated by Andrew Hughs and Colin Wallis and the MVCR v0.9 specification developed by the Kantara Initiative Consent & Information Sharing Work Group (2015) and continuing in ANCR WG (2018-2025). Contributors to the MVCR work include: John Wunderlich, Mary Hodder, Reuben Binns,  Renee Lloyd, Iain Henderson, Joe Andrieu, Dazza Greenwood,Tim Reiniger, Eve Maler, Joni Brennan, Joss Langford, Joel Geddes and Sal D'Agostino.  **In memory of Nick Givotovsky** 🕊️, whose contributions inspired the MVCR vision that continues to shape digital transparency infrastructure.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Non-Normative Demonstrator Status

**This document is a NON-NORMATIVE demonstrator submission** showing how transparency infrastructure COULD work if adopted. It has **NO authoritative status** and depends on multiple future events:

### Conditional Dependencies (All Must Occur):

1. **ISO/IEC 27560-1 Base Standard Adoption** (NOT YET ADOPTED)
    - This profile extends ISO/IEC 27560-1:2025, which is currently a submission draft
    - ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 has NOT adopted ISO/IEC 27560-1 as an international standard
    - **IF base standard not adopted → this profile cannot proceed**
2. **Convention 108+ Entry Into Force** (NOT YET RATIFIED)
    - This profile uses Convention 108+ as normative legal framework
    - Convention 108+ is eligible for treaty force in 2026 but NOT YET ratified by sufficient signatories
    - Current status: 55+ jurisdictions implementing, but treaty ratification incomplete
    - **IF Convention 108+ not ratified → legal framework lacks binding authority**
3. **Universal Notice Receipt Profile Adoption** (DEPENDS ON #1 AND #2)
    - This demonstrator must be formally adopted as an ISO/IEC 27560-1 profile
    - Adoption contingent on base standard approval AND normative framework authority
    - **IF either dependency fails → this profile has no standardization pathway**

### Dependency Chain:

```
Convention 108+ Ratification (2026+?)
           ↓
    +      ↓
ISO/IEC 27560-1 Adoption

### Current Legal Status:

- **NOT an international standard** (v1.0 submitted Dec 14, 2025; v1.01 internal draft only)
- **NOT legally binding** (no standards body has adopted this profile)
- **NOT authoritative for compliance** (demonstrator submission only)
- **NOT normative for any jurisdiction** (requires ISO adoption + Convention 108+ ratification)

### Version-Specific Status:

- **v1.0 (Dec 14, 2025)**: Submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 Canadian mirror committee — awaiting review
- **v1.01 (Dec 16-22, 2025)**: Internal working draft with post-submission clarifications — NOT submitted to standards body

✅ Inform policy development for Convention 108+ implementation

✅ Test interoperability between early adopters

### What You CANNOT Do:

❌ Claim conformance as if this were an adopted standard

❌ Assert legal compliance based on this profile alone

❌ Require third parties to implement without their agreement

❌ Reference as authoritative standard in contracts or regulations

❌ Assume Convention 108+ obligations apply without ratification

### Language Note:

**"SHALL" language throughout** this document describes requirements that WOULD apply IF this profile were adopted. Until adoption, read all SHALL as "should (if adopted)" or "would be required (upon adoption)".

**For Questions**: Contact Digital Transparency Lab or ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 Canadian mirror committee regarding adoption pathway and timeline.

## Executive summary

**Problem**: Digital identification enables controllers to infer identifiers instantly across borders before an individual can verify who is collecting data.

**Solution**: This profile inverts the architecture by putting **Controller-ID first, not Individual-ID first**. Controllers publish a **Controller Identification Record (CIR)** at a public location before any processing begins.

**Key innovation**: Bilateral receipts and Notice Event Logs enable proof of transparency state and enable scaled, automated oversight.

---

# Part 1 — Co-regulated notice receipt architecture

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Profile objectives

**Primary innovation: Four-stage ANCR (Anchored Notice and Consent Receipt) authorization exchange**

- **Stage 1: Notice Receipt** (mandatory)
    - Controller presents CIR before requesting any PII.
    - Individual can remain anonymous.
    - Both parties hold synchronized proof (Two-Factor Notice).
- **Stage 2: Authorization Receipt** (optional; context-dependent)
    - Individual returns Stage 1 receipt with explicit authorization.
- **Stage 3: Micro Notice Credential** (optional)
    - Cryptographically verifiable credential for API/device authorization.
- **Stage 4: Notice Token** (optional)
    - Portable authorization token anchored to individual-controlled identifier (for cross-controller portability).

### 1.2 Scope: digital privacy across all legal bases

Applies to PII processing under any Convention 108+ lawful basis:

- Consent
- Contract
- Legal obligation
- Legitimate interest
- Vital interest
- Public interest

### 1.3 Profile boundaries

- Stage 1 (Notice Receipt) is mandatory for base conformance.
- Stages 2 to 4 are optional protocol extensions.
- Field-level compatibility maintained with ISO/IEC 27560-1:2025 Section 6.5.

### 1.4 Terminology: notice and consent receipts

- **Notice Receipt**: universal bilateral record documenting controller notification under any legal basis.
- **Privacy receipt** (base standard term): notice receipt in PII contexts.
- **Consent receipt** (TS 27560:2023 term): notice receipt with authorization_type = consent_granted.

---

## 2. Normative references

### 2.1 Primary normative references

- Council of Europe **Convention 108+**
- ISO/IEC 27560:2025 WD (submission draft)
- ISO/IEC 29100:2011

### 2.2 Operational implementation references

- EU Regulation 2018/1725
- W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)

### 2.3 Non-normative references

- GDPR (EU 2016/679)
- ISO/IEC 29184:2020 (historical contribution; not normative here)

---

## 3. Terms and definitions (selected)

- **Controller Identification Record (CIR)**
- **Two-Factor Notice (2FN)**
- **Notice Event Log**
- **Anonymous-by-default** (Stage 1 shall not require pii_principal_id)

---

## 4. Abbreviations

- ANCR, CIR, 2FN, PII, WD

---

## 5. Universal notice receipt architecture

### 5.1 Relationship to ISO/IEC 27560-1:2025

This profile extends the base standard with a notice-first architecture and multi-basis applicability.

### 5.2 Co-regulated transparency infrastructure

Receipt generation can occur independently using public CIR information.

### 5.3 Anonymous-by-default architecture

Stage 1 removes pii_principal_id.

### 5.4 Controller Identification Record (CIR)

CIR is publicly accessible (for example: `/.well-known/transparency/notice.txt`).

### 5.5 Two-Factor Notice (2FN)

2FN provides bilateral proof-of-notice for both parties.

### 5.6 Notice Event Log

Append-only audit trail: issuance, authorization, material change, rights exercise.

---

## 6. ANCR Exchange Stage 1 — field specification

**Objective**: Specify the **Stage 1 (Notice Receipt)** field requirements for the Universal Notice Receipt Profile, implementing **Controller-ID first** and **anonymous-by-default** issuance.

### 6.1 Relationship to base ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 clause 6.3 structure

Stage 1 SHALL remain field-compatible with the base six-section organization described in ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 clause 6.3.2.2:

- record header section
- PII processing
- event
- purposes
- PII information section
- party identification section

Stage 1 implements the same sections, with the profile-specific architectural inversion that **pii_principal_id SHALL NOT be present** at Stage 1.

### 6.2 Stage 1 core architectural requirements

Stage 1 implementations SHALL:

1. Provide a Notice Receipt that can be issued and verified **without any PII Principal identification**.
2. Bind the Notice Receipt to a verifiable **Controller Identification Record (CIR)**.
3. Support **Two-Factor Notice (2FN)** so both the controller and the individual can hold synchronized proof-of-notice.
4. Provide a queryable, append-only **Notice Event Log** reference for state changes.

### 6.3 Stage 1 field specification (base mapping + profile extensions)

The Stage 1 field specification is defined as:

- **Base-field compatibility** with ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 (same field names and section placement), and
- **Profile extensions** required to support controller-id-first, notice-first issuance.

The complete Stage 1 mapping and specification is maintained in the workspace as:

- [Section 6.3: MVCR Field Mapping to Base ISO/IEC 27560:2023](https://www.notion.so/Section-6-3-MVCR-Field-Mapping-to-Base-ISO-IEC-27560-2023-e06aeb9017f643cdb006253435c81202?pvs=21)

For convenience, the Stage 1 specification requirements are summarized below as *mandatory Stage 1 requirements*.

#### 6.3.1 Record header section (Stage 1)

Stage 1 SHALL include:

- `schema_version`

Stage 1 MAY include:

- `permissions_bundle` (requested granular permissions; becomes mandatory at Stage 2+ when granted)

#### 6.3.3 Party identification section (Stage 1)

Stage 1 SHALL include controller party identification using base party fields (unchanged), structured as a Controller Identification Record (CIR) scoped to `party_role = "Controller"`.

Stage 1 SHALL additionally provide:

- `notice_event_log_url` **(profile-required)**
- `privacy_rights_controls` **(profile-required)**

#### 6.3.4 Event section (Stage 1)

# PART 2: AuthC EXCHANGE PROTOCOL

## Optional Extensions for Consent Portability and Agentic Coordination

### Section 12: Authorization Exchange Overview

**12.1 Addressing Base Standard Gap**

ISO/IEC 27560:2025 does not specify exchange protocol for privacy receipts. This authorization exchange protocol defines:

- Exchange pattern: How receipts flow between parties across four stages
- Exchange semantics: What each stage authorizes
- Exchange structure: Field additions per stage
- Universal applicability: Same pattern across privacy, safety, security, environment contexts

**12.2 Four-Stage Progression**

**ANCR Exchange Stage 1 (Notice Receipt)**: Notice acknowledgment (bilateral proof)

**ANCR Exchange Stage 2 (Consent Notice Receipt)**: Explicit authorization (consent, contract, policy acceptance, etc.)

**ANCR Exchange Stage 3 (Micro Notice Credential)**: Technical context authorization (API, device, remote verification)

**ANCR Exchange Stage 4 (Consent Token)**: Individual-controlled authorization portability (agentic coordination, consent authorization in digital wallets)

---

### Section 13: ANCR Exchange Stage 2 - Consent Notice Receipt

**13.1 Authorization Types by Context and Legal Basis**

**Privacy Context Authorizations**:

**Consent**: authorization_type="consent_granted"

- consent_timestamp, consent_type, permissions_bundle, pii_principal_id (optional)
- Enables secondary purpose consent using existing ANCR Exchange Stage 1 notice receipt

**Contract**: authorization_type="contract_accepted"

- contract_timestamp, contract_terms_version, permissions_bundle

**Legal Obligation**: authorization_type="legal_access_acknowledged"

- legal_authority_reference, access_scope, access_timestamp

**Legitimate Interest**: authorization_type="legitimate_interest_objection"

- balancing_test_reference, opt_out_mechanism, objection_timestamp

**Vital Interest**: authorization_type="emergency_notified"

- emergency_justification, emergency_timestamp, post_facto_notification

**Public Interest**: authorization_type="public_interest_participation"

- ethics_board_reference, public_benefit_description, participation_timestamp

**Non-Privacy Context Authorizations**:

**Safety**: authorization_type="safety_acknowledgment"

- hazard_description, safety_measures_required, acknowledgment_timestamp

**Security**: authorization_type="security_policy_acceptance"

- policy_version, security_requirements, acceptance_timestamp

**Environment**: authorization_type="environmental_disclosure_acknowledgment"

- disclosure_scope, environmental_impact, acknowledgment_timestamp

**Complete specifications**: See Appendix B (Legal Bases and Context Implementation)

---

### Section 14: ANCR Exchange Stage 3 - Micro Notice Credential

**14.1 Technical Context Authorization**

**Field Additions**:

- cryptographic_signature: Signature over receipt + permissions
- credential_binding: Device ID, session ID, API key
- technical_permissions_scope: API endpoints, data operations
- validity_period: Credential expiration

**Use Cases**:

- API authorization with granular permissions
- Cross-device authorization synchronization
- Third-party Controller verification without full receipt sharing
- IoT device authorization for safety/security contexts

---

### Section 15: ANCR Exchange Stage 4 - Consent Token

**15.1 Individual-Controlled Portability**

**Field Additions**:

- principal_anchor: DID, public key, wallet address
- token_claims: Issuer, subject, audience, expiration
- cross_controller_metadata: Original CIR-ID, provenance
- portability_scope: Geographic, jurisdictional, purpose restrictions

**Use Cases**:

- Agentic coordination with consent authorization tokens
- Authorization consent wallet management (privacy, safety, security contexts)
- Directed authorization to third-party controllers
- Cross-jurisdictional authorization portability

---

### Section 16: Authorization Exchange Conformance

**16.1 Conformance Levels**

**Universal Notice Receipt Conformance**: ANCR Exchange Stage 1 (mandatory for all contexts)

**Authorization Exchange Conformance**: ANCR Exchange Stage 1 + Stage 2 for applicable contexts

**Full Protocol Conformance**: ANCR Exchange Stages 1-4 (technical credentials and portability)

**16.2 Mandatory for Authorization Exchange**

- ANCR Exchange Stage 2 support for contexts requiring explicit authorization
- Notice Event Log updates for authorization events
- Authorization withdrawal/termination mechanism

---

### Section 17: Token Security Considerations

**17.1 Replay Attack Prevention**

- Unique token identifiers (jti)
- Time-bound tokens with expiration
- Nonce-based challenge-response

**17.2 Authorization Freshness Validation**

- Token issuance must be after latest Notice Event Log material change
- Controllers reject tokens issued before policy updates

**17.2.1 Active State Synchronic Validation (Level 4)**

For TATA Level 4 (Active State + Physical Verification) implementations, consent tokens SHALL include cryptographic binding to the notice.txt (CIR) state at time of issuance:

**Synchronic Matching Requirement**:

- Consent tokens SHALL include cryptographic hash of notice.txt (CIR) at time of token issuance
- Token verification SHALL confirm that current notice.txt matches the hashed version included in token
- If controller updates notice.txt (material change to CIR), all previously issued tokens become invalid until individual re-authorizes against updated CIR
- Notice Event Log SHALL record CIR version hash with each token issuance event

**Security Benefits**:

1. **Prevents Stale Consent Exploits**: Tokens automatically invalidate when CIR changes, preventing controllers from relying on old authorizations after changing processing terms
2. **Prevents CIR Hijacking**: Attacker cannot serve fake notice.txt at unauthorized endpoint—token verification fails if CIR hash doesn't match registry-signed version
3. **Prevents Fake Hash Injection**: Token hash must match both current CIR AND Notice Event Log entry—controller cannot forge hash without registry detection
4. **Enables Real-Time Compliance**: Regulators verify token validity by comparing CIR hash against Notice Event Log without controller cooperation

**Implementation Pattern**:

```json
{
  "token_claims": {
    "iss": "CIR-CA-12345",
    "jti": "receipt-abc-123",
    "iat": "2025-12-13T19:00:00-05:00",
    "exp": "2026-12-13T19:00:00-05:00",
    "cir_hash_at_issuance": "sha256:a1b2c3d4...",
    "cir_publication_url": "https://example.com/.well-known/transparency/notice.txt",
    "notice_event_log_verification_url": "https://example.com/.well-known/transparency/notice-event-log.jsonl"
  }
}
```

**Verification Protocol**:

1. Extract `cir_hash_at_issuance` from token
2. Fetch current notice.txt from `cir_publication_url`
3. Compute hash of current notice.txt
4. Compare computed hash with `cir_hash_at_issuance`
5. If mismatch: Token invalid—CIR has been updated since token issuance
6. Query Notice Event Log to confirm `cir_hash_at_issuance` matches log entry at token `iat` timestamp
7. If log mismatch: Token invalid—hash was forged or CIR was hijacked

**Attack Prevention**:

**Attack 1: CIR Hijacking at Unauthorized Endpoint**

- Attacker serves fake notice.txt at compromised endpoint
- Token contains hash of legitimate CIR from registry
- Verification fails: fake notice.txt hash ≠ token `cir_hash_at_issuance`
- **Defense**: Cryptographic binding prevents acceptance of hijacked CIR

**Attack 2: Fake Hash Injection in Token**

- Attacker creates token with fake `cir_hash_at_issuance`
- Verification queries Notice Event Log for CIR hash at token `iat` timestamp
- Log hash ≠ token hash (registry signed log cannot be forged)
- **Defense**: Notice Event Log provides authoritative hash history—token rejected if hash doesn't match log

**Attack 3: Stale Consent After Material Change**

- Controller updates notice.txt (changes `scope_of_disclosure` from regional to international)
- Old tokens contain hash of pre-change CIR
- Verification computes hash of current notice.txt
- Current hash ≠ token `cir_hash_at_issuance`
- **Defense**: Automatic token invalidation forces re-authorization under new terms

**Regulatory Oversight**:

- Supervisory authorities verify token validity by:
    1. Retrieving token from data subject or controller
    2. Querying public Notice Event Log for CIR hash at token issuance time
    3. Comparing with current CIR hash
    4. Automated detection of tokens issued under outdated terms

> **Editorial Note for v1.1**: Active State Synchronic Validation will be standardized as mandatory for TATA Level 4 implementations in v1.1. Current v1.0 version documents the pattern as INFORMATIVE guidance for Level 4 implementers. V1.1 will specify: normative hash algorithm requirements (SHA-256 minimum), Notice Event Log CIR version tracking protocols, and cross-registry CIR hash verification standards for international token portability.
> 

**17.3 Revocation Mechanism**

- Notice Event Log tracks revocation events
- Controllers maintain revocation list
- Real-time revocation check API
