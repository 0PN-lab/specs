**Historical Context**: This profile operationalizes **Council of Europe Convention 108+ transparency requirements** as digital public infrastructure for co-regulated transparency. Completes the **MVCR - Open Notice** purpose co-invented in 2013 by Phil Pearce and Reuben Binns, and formalized as the Minimum Viable Consent Receipt (MVCR v0.9) specification by the Kantara Initiative in 2015. The MVCR work was adopted as the foundation for ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 and referenced in ISO/IEC 29184:2020 Appendix D. Rather than creating a new code of conduct, this profile implements Convention 108+ Articles 5, 8, 9, 10, and 14 as operational transparency infrastructure supporting all six legal bases through bilateral notice receipts, public Controller Identification Records, and Notice Event Logs.

**Acknowledgments**: This profile builds upon the foundational **MVCR - Open Notice** architecture co-invented with Valentino Spataro, Phil Pearce and Reuben Binns (2013), facilitated by Andrew Hughs and Colin Wallis and the MVCR v0.9 specification developed by the Kantara Initiative Consent & Information Sharing Work Group (2015) and continuing in ANCR WG (2018-2025). Contributors to the MVCR work include: John Wunderlich, Mary Hodder, Reuben Binns,  Renee Lloyd, Iain Henderson, Joe Andrieu, Dazza Greenwood,Tim Reiniger, Eve Maler, Joni Brennan, Joss Langford, Joel Geddes and Sal D'Agostino.  **In memory of Nick Givotovsky** 🕊️, whose contributions inspired the MVCR vision that continues to shape digital transparency infrastructure.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Non-Normative Demonstrator Status

**This document is a NON-NORMATIVE demonstrator submission** showing how transparency infrastructure COULD work if adopted. It has **NO authoritative status** and depends on multiple future events:

### Conditional Dependencies (All Must Occur):

1. **ISO/IEC 27560-1 Base Standard Adoption** (NOT YET ADOPTED)
    - This profile extends ISO/IEC 27560-1:2025, which is currently a submission draft
    - ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 has NOT adopted ISO/IEC 27560-1 as an international standard
    - **IF base standard not adopted → this profile cannot proceed**
2. **Convention 108+ Entry Into Force** (NOT YET RATIFIED)
    - This profile uses Convention 108+ as normative legal framework
    - Convention 108+ is eligible for treaty force in 2026 but NOT YET ratified by sufficient signatories
    - Current status: 55+ jurisdictions implementing, but treaty ratification incomplete
    - **IF Convention 108+ not ratified → legal framework lacks binding authority**
3. **Universal Notice Receipt Profile Adoption** (DEPENDS ON #1 AND #2)
    - This demonstrator must be formally adopted as an ISO/IEC 27560-1 profile
    - Adoption contingent on base standard approval AND normative framework authority
    - **IF either dependency fails → this profile has no standardization pathway**

### Dependency Chain:

```
Convention 108+ Ratification (2026+?)
           ↓
    +      ↓
ISO/IEC 27560-1 Adoption
           ↓
           ↓

### Current Legal Status:

- **NOT an international standard** (v1.0 submitted Dec 14, 2025; v1.01 internal draft only)
- **NOT legally binding** (no standards body has adopted this profile)
- **NOT authoritative for compliance** (demonstrator submission only)
- **NOT normative for any jurisdiction** (requires ISO adoption + Convention 108+ ratification)

### Version-Specific Status:

- **v1.0 (Dec 14, 2025)**: Submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 Canadian mirror committee — awaiting review
- **v1.01 (Dec 16-22, 2025)**: Internal working draft with post-submission clarifications — NOT submitted to standards body
- **Current status**: v1.01 internal draft — for stakeholder engagement and pilot reference only

### Intended Use:

- **Demonstrator** of co-regulated transparency architecture
- **Reference implementation** for standards body consideration
- **Technical specification** showing feasibility of Controller-ID first approach
- **Stakeholder engagement** tool for pilot implementations

### What You CAN Do With This Document:

✅ Use as reference for pilot implementations

✅ Demonstrate technical feasibility to standards bodies

✅ Engage stakeholders in transparency infrastructure design

✅ Inform policy development for Convention 108+ implementation

✅ Test interoperability between early adopters

### What You CANNOT Do:

❌ Claim conformance as if this were an adopted standard

❌ Assert legal compliance based on this profile alone

❌ Require third parties to implement without their agreement

❌ Reference as authoritative standard in contracts or regulations

❌ Assume Convention 108+ obligations apply without ratification

### Language Note:

**"SHALL" language throughout** this document describes requirements that WOULD apply IF this profile were adopted. Until adoption, read all SHALL as "should (if adopted)" or "would be required (upon adoption)".

**For Questions**: Contact Digital Transparency Lab or ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 Canadian mirror committee regarding adoption pathway and timeline.

## Executive summary

**Problem**: Digital identification enables controllers to infer identifiers instantly across borders before an individual can verify who is collecting data.

**Solution**: This profile inverts the architecture by putting **Controller-ID first, not Individual-ID first**. Controllers publish a **Controller Identification Record (CIR)** at a public location before any processing begins.

**Key innovation**: Bilateral receipts and Notice Event Logs enable proof of transparency state and enable scaled, automated oversight.

---

# Part 1 — Co-regulated notice receipt architecture

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Profile objectives

**Primary innovation: Four-stage ANCR (Anchored Notice and Consent Receipt) authorization exchange**

- **Stage 1: Notice Receipt** (mandatory)
    - Controller presents CIR before requesting any PII.
    - Individual can remain anonymous.
    - Both parties hold synchronized proof (Two-Factor Notice).
- **Stage 2: Authorization Receipt** (optional; context-dependent)
    - Individual returns Stage 1 receipt with explicit authorization.
- **Stage 3: Micro Notice Credential** (optional)
    - Cryptographically verifiable credential for API/device authorization.
- **Stage 4: Notice Token** (optional)
    - Portable authorization token anchored to individual-controlled identifier (for cross-controller portability).

### 1.2 Scope: digital privacy across all legal bases

Applies to PII processing under any Convention 108+ lawful basis:

- Consent
- Contract
- Legal obligation
- Legitimate interest
- Vital interest
- Public interest

### 1.3 Profile boundaries

- Stage 1 (Notice Receipt) is mandatory for base conformance.
- Stages 2 to 4 are optional protocol extensions.
- Field-level compatibility maintained with ISO/IEC 27560-1:2025 Section 6.5.

### 1.4 Terminology: notice and consent receipts

- **Notice Receipt**: universal bilateral record documenting controller notification under any legal basis.
- **Privacy receipt** (base standard term): notice receipt in PII contexts.
- **Consent receipt** (TS 27560:2023 term): notice receipt with authorization_type = consent_granted.

---

## 2. Normative references

### 2.1 Primary normative references

- Council of Europe **Convention 108+**
- ISO/IEC 27560:2025 WD (submission draft)
- ISO/IEC 29100:2011

### 2.2 Operational implementation references

- EU Regulation 2018/1725
- W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)

### 2.3 Non-normative references

- GDPR (EU 2016/679)
- ISO/IEC 29184:2020 (historical contribution; not normative here)

---

## 3. Terms and definitions (selected)

- **Controller Identification Record (CIR)**
- **Two-Factor Notice (2FN)**
- **Notice Event Log**
- **Anonymous-by-default** (Stage 1 shall not require pii_principal_id)

---

## 4. Abbreviations

- ANCR, CIR, 2FN, PII, WD

---

## 5. Universal notice receipt architecture

### 5.1 Relationship to ISO/IEC 27560-1:2025

This profile extends the base standard with a notice-first architecture and multi-basis applicability.

### 5.2 Co-regulated transparency infrastructure

Receipt generation can occur independently using public CIR information.

### 5.3 Anonymous-by-default architecture

Stage 1 removes pii_principal_id.

### 5.4 Controller Identification Record (CIR)

CIR is publicly accessible (for example: `/.well-known/transparency/notice.txt`).

### 5.5 Two-Factor Notice (2FN)

2FN provides bilateral proof-of-notice for both parties.

### 5.6 Notice Event Log

Append-only audit trail: issuance, authorization, material change, rights exercise.

---

## 6. ANCR Exchange Stage 1 — field specification

**Objective**: Specify the **Stage 1 (Notice Receipt)** field requirements for the Universal Notice Receipt Profile, implementing **Controller-ID first** and **anonymous-by-default** issuance.

### 6.1 Relationship to base ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 clause 6.3 structure

Stage 1 SHALL remain field-compatible with the base six-section organization described in ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 clause 6.3.2.2:

- record header section
- PII processing
- event
- purposes
- PII information section
- party identification section

Stage 1 implements the same sections, with the profile-specific architectural inversion that **pii_principal_id SHALL NOT be present** at Stage 1.

### 6.2 Stage 1 core architectural requirements

Stage 1 implementations SHALL:

1. Provide a Notice Receipt that can be issued and verified **without any PII Principal identification**.
2. Bind the Notice Receipt to a verifiable **Controller Identification Record (CIR)**.
3. Support **Two-Factor Notice (2FN)** so both the controller and the individual can hold synchronized proof-of-notice.
4. Provide a queryable, append-only **Notice Event Log** reference for state changes.

### 6.3 Stage 1 field specification (base mapping + profile extensions)

The Stage 1 field specification is defined as:

- **Base-field compatibility** with ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 (same field names and section placement), and
- **Profile extensions** required to support controller-id-first, notice-first issuance.

The complete Stage 1 mapping and specification is maintained in the workspace as:

- [Section 6.3: MVCR Field Mapping to Base ISO/IEC 27560:2023](https://www.notion.so/Section-6-3-MVCR-Field-Mapping-to-Base-ISO-IEC-27560-2023-e06aeb9017f643cdb006253435c81202?pvs=21)

For convenience, the Stage 1 specification requirements are summarized below as *mandatory Stage 1 requirements*.

#### 6.3.1 Record header section (Stage 1)

Stage 1 SHALL include:

- `schema_version`
- `receipt_id` (base record_id renamed for receipt instance tracking)
- `receipt_timestamp` (base record_timestamp renamed)

- `notice_receipt_type` = "Stage 1" **(profile-required)**
- `two_factor_notice_indicator` = true **(profile-required)**

Stage 1 SHALL NOT include:

- `pii_principal_id`

#### 6.3.2 PII processing section (Stage 1)

Stage 1 SHALL include the base processing disclosure fields applicable to notice, including:

Stage 1 MAY include:

- `permissions_bundle` (requested granular permissions; becomes mandatory at Stage 2+ when granted)

#### 6.3.3 Party identification section (Stage 1)

Stage 1 SHALL include controller party identification using base party fields (unchanged), structured as a Controller Identification Record (CIR) scoped to `party_role = "Controller"`.

Stage 1 SHALL additionally provide:

- `notice_event_log_url` **(profile-required)**
- `privacy_rights_controls` **(profile-required)**

#### 6.3.4 Event section (Stage 1)

Stage 1 SHALL include:

- `event_time`
- `event_type` = `notice_issued` (or equivalent notice issuance event)
- `entity_id` (CIR-ID for controller-initiated events)
- `notice_event_log_id` **(profile-required)**

### 6.4 Conformance note

This Stage 1 specification is a **privacy-enabling** notice-first profile: it enables the individual to evaluate the controller and transparency terms prior to any identification or permission enforcement.

---

## 7. Conformance

### 7.1 Mandatory for Universal Notice Receipt Profile conformance

1. CIR publication before processing.
2. CIR accessible without authentication.

---

# PART 2: AuthC EXCHANGE PROTOCOL

## Optional Extensions for Consent Portability and Agentic Coordination

### Section 12: Authorization Exchange Overview

**12.1 Addressing Base Standard Gap**

ISO/IEC 27560:2025 does not specify exchange protocol for privacy receipts. This authorization exchange protocol defines:

- Exchange pattern: How receipts flow between parties across four stages
- Exchange semantics: What each stage authorizes
- Exchange structure: Field additions per stage
- Universal applicability: Same pattern across privacy, safety, security, environment contexts

**12.2 Four-Stage Progression**

**ANCR Exchange Stage 1 (Notice Receipt)**: Notice acknowledgment (bilateral proof)

**ANCR Exchange Stage 2 (Consent Notice Receipt)**: Explicit authorization (consent, contract, policy acceptance, etc.)

**ANCR Exchange Stage 3 (Micro Notice Credential)**: Technical context authorization (API, device, remote verification)

**ANCR Exchange Stage 4 (Consent Token)**: Individual-controlled authorization portability (agentic coordination, consent authorization in digital wallets)

---

### Section 13: ANCR Exchange Stage 2 - Consent Notice Receipt

**13.1 Authorization Types by Context and Legal Basis**

**Privacy Context Authorizations**:

**Consent**: authorization_type="consent_granted"

- consent_timestamp, consent_type, permissions_bundle, pii_principal_id (optional)
- Enables secondary purpose consent using existing ANCR Exchange Stage 1 notice receipt

**Contract**: authorization_type="contract_accepted"

- contract_timestamp, contract_terms_version, permissions_bundle

**Legal Obligation**: authorization_type="legal_access_acknowledged"

- legal_authority_reference, access_scope, access_timestamp

**Legitimate Interest**: authorization_type="legitimate_interest_objection"

- balancing_test_reference, opt_out_mechanism, objection_timestamp

**Vital Interest**: authorization_type="emergency_notified"

- emergency_justification, emergency_timestamp, post_facto_notification

**Public Interest**: authorization_type="public_interest_participation"

- ethics_board_reference, public_benefit_description, participation_timestamp

**Non-Privacy Context Authorizations**:

**Safety**: authorization_type="safety_acknowledgment"

- hazard_description, safety_measures_required, acknowledgment_timestamp

**Security**: authorization_type="security_policy_acceptance"

- policy_version, security_requirements, acceptance_timestamp

**Environment**: authorization_type="environmental_disclosure_acknowledgment"

- disclosure_scope, environmental_impact, acknowledgment_timestamp

**Complete specifications**: See Appendix B (Legal Bases and Context Implementation)

---

### Section 14: ANCR Exchange Stage 3 - Micro Notice Credential

**14.1 Technical Context Authorization**

**Field Additions**:

- cryptographic_signature: Signature over receipt + permissions
- credential_binding: Device ID, session ID, API key
- technical_permissions_scope: API endpoints, data operations
- validity_period: Credential expiration

**Use Cases**:

- API authorization with granular permissions
- Cross-device authorization synchronization
- Third-party Controller verification without full receipt sharing
- IoT device authorization for safety/security contexts

---

### Section 15: ANCR Exchange Stage 4 - Consent Token

**15.1 Individual-Controlled Portability**

**Field Additions**:

- principal_anchor: DID, public key, wallet address
- token_claims: Issuer, subject, audience, expiration
- cross_controller_metadata: Original CIR-ID, provenance
- portability_scope: Geographic, jurisdictional, purpose restrictions

**Use Cases**:

- Agentic coordination with consent authorization tokens
- Authorization consent wallet management (privacy, safety, security contexts)
- Directed authorization to third-party controllers
- Cross-jurisdictional authorization portability

---

### Section 16: Authorization Exchange Conformance

**16.1 Conformance Levels**

**Universal Notice Receipt Conformance**: ANCR Exchange Stage 1 (mandatory for all contexts)

**Authorization Exchange Conformance**: ANCR Exchange Stage 1 + Stage 2 for applicable contexts

**Full Protocol Conformance**: ANCR Exchange Stages 1-4 (technical credentials and portability)

**16.2 Mandatory for Authorization Exchange**

- ANCR Exchange Stage 2 support for contexts requiring explicit authorization
- Notice Event Log updates for authorization events
- Authorization withdrawal/termination mechanism

---

### Section 17: Token Security Considerations

**17.1 Replay Attack Prevention**

- Unique token identifiers (jti)
- Time-bound tokens with expiration
- Nonce-based challenge-response

**17.2 Authorization Freshness Validation**

- Token issuance must be after latest Notice Event Log material change
- Controllers reject tokens issued before policy updates

**17.2.1 Active State Synchronic Validation (Level 4)**

For TATA Level 4 (Active State + Physical Verification) implementations, consent tokens SHALL include cryptographic binding to the notice.txt (CIR) state at time of issuance:

**Synchronic Matching Requirement**:

- Consent tokens SHALL include cryptographic hash of notice.txt (CIR) at time of token issuance
- Token verification SHALL confirm that current notice.txt matches the hashed version included in token
- If controller updates notice.txt (material change to CIR), all previously issued tokens become invalid until individual re-authorizes against updated CIR
- Notice Event Log SHALL record CIR version hash with each token issuance event

**Security Benefits**:

1. **Prevents Stale Consent Exploits**: Tokens automatically invalidate when CIR changes, preventing controllers from relying on old authorizations after changing processing terms
2. **Prevents CIR Hijacking**: Attacker cannot serve fake notice.txt at unauthorized endpoint—token verification fails if CIR hash doesn't match registry-signed version
3. **Prevents Fake Hash Injection**: Token hash must match both current CIR AND Notice Event Log entry—controller cannot forge hash without registry detection
4. **Enables Real-Time Compliance**: Regulators verify token validity by comparing CIR hash against Notice Event Log without controller cooperation

**Implementation Pattern**:

```json
{
  "token_claims": {
    "iss": "CIR-CA-12345",
    "jti": "receipt-abc-123",
    "iat": "2025-12-13T19:00:00-05:00",
    "exp": "2026-12-13T19:00:00-05:00",
    "cir_hash_at_issuance": "sha256:a1b2c3d4...",
    "cir_publication_url": "https://example.com/.well-known/transparency/notice.txt",
    "notice_event_log_verification_url": "https://example.com/.well-known/transparency/notice-event-log.jsonl"
  }
}
```

**Verification Protocol**:

1. Extract `cir_hash_at_issuance` from token
2. Fetch current notice.txt from `cir_publication_url`
3. Compute hash of current notice.txt
4. Compare computed hash with `cir_hash_at_issuance`
5. If mismatch: Token invalid—CIR has been updated since token issuance
6. Query Notice Event Log to confirm `cir_hash_at_issuance` matches log entry at token `iat` timestamp
7. If log mismatch: Token invalid—hash was forged or CIR was hijacked

**Attack Prevention**:

**Attack 1: CIR Hijacking at Unauthorized Endpoint**

- Attacker serves fake notice.txt at compromised endpoint
- Token contains hash of legitimate CIR from registry
- Verification fails: fake notice.txt hash ≠ token `cir_hash_at_issuance`
- **Defense**: Cryptographic binding prevents acceptance of hijacked CIR

**Attack 2: Fake Hash Injection in Token**

- Attacker creates token with fake `cir_hash_at_issuance`
- Verification queries Notice Event Log for CIR hash at token `iat` timestamp
- Log hash ≠ token hash (registry signed log cannot be forged)
- **Defense**: Notice Event Log provides authoritative hash history—token rejected if hash doesn't match log

**Attack 3: Stale Consent After Material Change**

- Controller updates notice.txt (changes `scope_of_disclosure` from regional to international)
- Old tokens contain hash of pre-change CIR
- Verification computes hash of current notice.txt
- Current hash ≠ token `cir_hash_at_issuance`
- **Defense**: Automatic token invalidation forces re-authorization under new terms

**Regulatory Oversight**:

- Supervisory authorities verify token validity by:
    1. Retrieving token from data subject or controller
    2. Querying public Notice Event Log for CIR hash at token issuance time
    3. Comparing with current CIR hash
    4. Automated detection of tokens issued under outdated terms

> **Editorial Note for v1.1**: Active State Synchronic Validation will be standardized as mandatory for TATA Level 4 implementations in v1.1. Current v1.0 version documents the pattern as INFORMATIVE guidance for Level 4 implementers. V1.1 will specify: normative hash algorithm requirements (SHA-256 minimum), Notice Event Log CIR version tracking protocols, and cross-registry CIR hash verification standards for international token portability.
> 

**17.3 Revocation Mechanism**

- Notice Event Log tracks revocation events
- Controllers maintain revocation list
- Real-time revocation check API

**Removed Fields**:

- pii_principal_id (ANCR Exchange Stage 1 only; optional Stage 2+)

**New Fields**:

- controller_identity_record_id (CIR-ID)
- cir_publication_url (public CIR location)
- notice_receipt_type (ANCR Exchange Stage 1-4)
- notice_type (notification, disclosure, policy, signal)
- context_category (privacy, safety, security, environment)
- two_factor_notice_indicator (boolean)
- scope_of_disclosure (risk category)
- permissions_bundle (granular permissions/authorizations)
- authorization_type (ANCR Exchange Stage 2 semantic variation)

**Enhanced Fields**:

- party_id → CIR-ID when party_role="Controller"
- event_type → universal context values (notice_issued, consent_granted, safety_acknowledged, etc.)
- processing_locations → scope_of_disclosure determination

### Appendix B: Legal Bases and Context Implementation

**Purpose**: Demonstrates universal notice receipt implementation across all Convention 108+ legal bases and non-privacy contexts.

#### B.1 Consent (Privacy Context)

ANCR Exchange Stage 1 notice receipt + Stage 2 consent authorization enables secondary purpose consent.

#### B.2 Contract (Privacy Context)

**Standard Contract Flow:**

Individual-proffered terms pattern using ANCR Exchange Stage 1 + Stage 2.

**Contract + Consent Flow (Two-Stage Authorization):**

When contractual processing requires separate consent for personal data processing:

**Stage 1: Initial Consent for Personal Data Processing**

- ANCR Exchange Stage 1: Notice Receipt for personal data processing
- ANCR Exchange Stage 2: Consent authorization (authorization_type="consent_granted")
- Legal basis: **Consent** for collection and processing of personal data
- Purpose: Enable contractual relationship through personal data provision
- Notice Event Log records: consent_granted for personal data processing

**Stage 2: Contract Acceptance with Secondary Purpose**

- ANCR Exchange Stage 1: Notice Receipt for contractual terms (references first consent receipt)
- ANCR Exchange Stage 2: Contract authorization (authorization_type="contract_accepted")
- Legal basis: **Contract** for service delivery using consented personal data
- Purpose: Contractual obligations and service provision
- Notice Event Log records: contract_accepted referencing prior consent_granted
- consent_receipt_chain: Links to Stage 1 consent receipt ID

**Use Cases:**

- Financial services requiring consent for data collection before contract execution
- Employment contracts separating personal data consent from contractual obligations
- Service agreements where data processing requires separate consent authorization
- Contexts requiring explicit consent for identification before contractual relationship

**Field Requirements for Two-Stage Flow:**

```json
{
  "authorization_type": "contract_accepted",
  "contract_timestamp": "2025-12-11T11:00:00Z",
  "contract_terms_version": "v2.0",
  "permissions_bundle": ["service_delivery", "contractual_obligations"],
  "prerequisite_consent_receipt_id": "consent_receipt_xyz_123",
  "consent_receipt_chain": ["consent_receipt_xyz_123"],
  "lawful_basis_primary": "contract",
  "lawful_basis_prerequisite": "consent"
}
```

**Notice Event Log Entries:**

1. Stage 1: `consent_granted` for personal data processing
2. Stage 2: `contract_accepted` with reference to prerequisite consent
3. Material changes to either consent or contract trigger new notice receipts

#### B.3 Legal Obligation (Privacy Context)

Regulatory transparency enforcement with ANCR Exchange Stage 1 + optional Stage 3.

#### B.4 Legitimate Interest (Privacy Context)

Balancing test transparency with opt-out mechanism.

#### B.5 Vital Interest (Privacy Context)

Emergency authority coordination with post-facto notification.

#### B.6 Public Interest (Privacy Context)

Research, journalism, archiving transparency.

#### B.7 Legal Access (Privacy Context - Warrant Tokens)

Constitutional compliance with lawful access documentation.

#### B.8 Safety Contexts

Product recalls, hazard warnings, emergency notifications, providence, supply chain.

#### B.9 Security Contexts

Acceptable use policies, incident disclosures, access control.

#### B.10 Environment Contexts

Environmental impact disclosures, sustainability reporting.

**Access Point**: All rights exercised via CIR rights_access_point (universal across contexts).

---

### Appendix D: Emergency Protocols

**Break-the-Glass Scenario (Privacy Context):**

1. Generate emergency notice receipt with emergency_justification
2. Log emergency access in Notice Event Log
3. Post-facto notification when legally permitted
4. Provide 2FN required receipt for right to object or request erasure post-emergency

**Regulatory Logging**: Controllers log emergency access per jurisdiction requirements (e.g., 72 hours).

**Non-Privacy Emergency Scenarios**:

- Safety: Immediate hazard notification with post-facto receipt issuance
- Security: Incident response with contemporaneous or post-facto notification
- Environment: Environmental incident disclosure with regulatory notification

---

### Appendix E: Open Questions for Reviewers

#### Comments for Reviewers: Article 80 and Article 88 References

**Operational Personal Data Logging and Access Rights**

This profile references **EU Regulation 2018/1725 Articles 80 and 88** as the operational implementation of Convention 108+ transparency requirements for **operational personal data** contexts.

**Article 80 (Right of Access by the Data Subject):**

- Data subjects have the right to access their operational personal data and related information
- Access may be restricted to protect investigations, public security, or rights of others
- Implemented via the universal `rights_access_point` field in the CIR

**Article 88 (Logging):**

- Controllers must keep logs for processing operations in automated processing systems: collection, alteration, access, consultation, disclosure (including transfers), combination, and erasure
- Logs must establish justification, date/time, identification of who consulted/disclosed data, and recipient identity
- Logs available to DPO/EDPS on request
- Implemented via the **Notice Event Log** specification

**Distinction from Lawful Access/Surveillance**:

- Operational personal data (Articles 80/88) = processing by EU institutions for security/law enforcement tasks
- Lawful access/interception = surveillance powers disclosed via `surveillance_risks`

**Reviewer Consideration:**

Does the Notice Event Log specification adequately address Article 88 logging requirements for operational personal data contexts while remaining applicable across all universal contexts (privacy, safety, security, environment)?

#### Comments for Reviewers: PII Principal Jurisdiction Field

**New Field Addition: pii_principal_jurisdiction**

Rationale:

1. Risk-proportionate disclosure (surveillance risks differ by jurisdiction)
2. Informed consent for cross-border transfers
3. Jurisdictional rights determination
4. Adequacy assessment requires source and destination jurisdictions

Privacy-preserving implementation:

- Not collected in Stage 1
- Conditional in Stage 2+ (cross-border contexts)
- Determination method disclosure
- Accuracy/correction support

Reviewer considerations:

1. Does conditional collection balance transparency and privacy preservation?
2. Should determination method disclosure be mandatory?
3. Is ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 / ISO 3166-2 granularity appropriate?
4. Should the field be recommended vs optional when transfer_mechanism="consent"?

Alternative approaches considered:

- Generic disclosure only (rejected)
- Controller jurisdiction proxy (rejected)
- Post-hoc determination (rejected)

#### Comments for Reviewers: Normative Reference Strategy

GDPR replaced with Convention 108+ and EU Regulation 2018/1725.

### Appendix G: Backward Compatibility with ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023

#### G.1 Terminology Evolution

| Universal Notice Receipt Term | 2025 WD Term | 2023 TS Term | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Notice receipt (universal) | Privacy receipt | Consent receipt | 2023 scope limited to consent only |
| Notice record (universal) | PII processing record | Consent record | 2023 scope limited to consent only |
| authorization_type | (implicit in lawful_basis) | N/A | New field for multi-basis and multi-context |
| notice_type | N/A | N/A | New field for context categorization |
| context_category | N/A | N/A | New field for domain categorization |
| Controller-ID Notice Receipt | N/A | N/A | Completes original MVCR purpose |
| Co-regulated infrastructure | N/A | N/A | Independent receipt generation capability |

#### G.2 Field Migration

| 2023 TS Field | 2023 Clause | Universal Notice Receipt Field | Migration Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| record_id | 6.3.3.2 | receipt_id | Rename for semantic clarity |
| pii_principal_id | 6.3.3.1 | pii_principal_id | Make optional in Stage 1 |
| party_id (Controller) | 6.3.6.2 | controller_identity_record_id | Enhance with public registry verification |
| (none) | N/A | cir_publication_url | Add public CIR location |
| (none) | N/A | notice_type | Add for context categorization |
| (none) | N/A | context_category | Add for domain categorization |
| (none) | N/A | authorization_type | Add for Stage 2 multi-basis/context support |
| (none) | N/A | scope_of_disclosure | Add for risk-proportionate transparency |
| (none) | N/A | two_factor_notice_indicator | Add for 2FN pattern |

#### G.3 Migration Strategy

**For 2023 TS Implementers:**

1. Current 2023 TS consent record implementations remain valid
2. Adopt ANCR Exchange Stage 1 (Notice Receipt) as enhancement
3. Publish CIR at public location (/.well-known/transparency)
4. Maintain 2023 field compatibility while adding universal extensions
5. When 2025 IS publishes, adopt full multi-basis and multi-context support
6. Implement directly against 2025 WD with Universal Notice Receipt Profile
7. Use the migration table for 2023 TS interoperability
8. Deploy with confidence that 2023 systems can exchange receipts
9. Enable co-regulated infrastructure through public CIR publication

Bridge notes:

- Universal notice receipts (Stage 1) can be exchanged with 2023 TS systems
- schema_version enables version detection
- 2023 systems interpret universal notice receipts as consent receipts (ignore new fields)
- Universal systems read 2023 receipts and map to Stage 2 consent context

      "legal_regime": "FISA Section 702 permits government access to data of non-US persons"
    },
    {
      "country_code": "CA",
      "role": "ai_inference",
      "adequacy_status": "adequate",
      "data_processed": "Real-time inference processed in Canadian data centers"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### J.6 Conformance and Standards Alignment

**J.6.1 Optional AI System Transparency Extension**

Organizations claiming an **AI System Transparency Extension** conformance SHALL:

1. Implement Universal Notice Receipt Profile (mandatory base)
2. Use `context_category="ai_system"` when AI systems process personal data
3. Log AI-specific events per J.3
4. Disclose human oversight mechanism in authorization and/or CIR documentation
5. Disclose cross-border AI deployment jurisdictions when `scope_of_disclosure="international"`

---

#### J.7 Implementation Guidance

**For Controllers deploying AI systems**:

- Classify AI risk level using applicable framework
- Extend CIR with `ai_system_documentation` if high-risk
- Generate Stage 1 notice receipt with ai_system context before processing
- Configure Notice Event Log to capture AI-specific events
- Provide explainability mechanism via `rights_access_point`

**Appendix J Status**: INFORMATIVE

**Conformance Impact**: None

**V1.1 Scope**: Standardize AI-specific requirements after base infrastructure adoption

### Appendix K (Informative): Enhanced Transparency Features for v1.1

**Status**: INFORMATIVE — This appendix documents advanced features deferred from v1.0 for future standardization. None of these features affect v1.0 conformance.

#### K.1 Privacy Preference Signals

**Deferred Rationale**: GPC integration and preference indicator infrastructure add implementation complexity beyond v1.0's core bilateral receipt architecture.

**Proposed v1.1 Specification**:

When `scope_of_disclosure` includes processing subject to preference signals, the following fields enable preference integration.

**K.1.1 privacy_preference_signals Object**

```json
{
  "privacy_preference_signals": {
    "gpc_honored": true,
    "gpc_scope": ["analytics", "third_party_disclosure"],
    "dnt_recognized": false,
    "preference_center_url": "https://example.com/privacy-preferences",
    "preference_binding": "browser_signal"
  }
}
```

**Field Definitions**:

- **gpc_honored** (boolean): Whether W3C Global Privacy Control signal is respected.
- **gpc_scope** (array): Processing categories affected by GPC.
- **dnt_recognized** (boolean): Whether Do Not Track signal is recognized.
- **preference_center_url** (string): URL where individuals can manage preferences.
- **preference_binding** (enum): How preferences are enforced: `browser_signal`, `receipt_anchored`, `account_based`.

**Integration with Notice Event Log**:

- Log preference signal changes with `event_type="preference_signal_received"`.
- Record preference enforcement with `event_type="processing_restricted_by_preference"`.

---

#### K.2 Transparency Assurance and Trust Assurance Indicators

**Deferred Rationale**: TATA indicator signaling and trustmark infrastructure requires coordinated implementation across registries, TTAOs, and visual standard bodies.

**K.2.1 transparency_assurance_level Field**

```json
{
  "transparency_assurance_level": 2,
  "tata_description": "Registry Verification—CIR-ID registered with authoritative source",
    "registry_verification_url": "12345",
  "last_verification_date": "2025-12-01"
}
```

**TATA Levels**:

- **Level 1**: Self-Assertion
- **Level 2**: Registry Verification
- **Level 3**: Notarized Receipts via Blind Data Notary
- **Level 4**: Physical Verification + Active State

**K.2.2 trustmark_certifications Array**

```json
{
  "trustmark_certifications": [
    {
      "trustmark_type": "habni_active_state",
      "certification_body": "Digital Transparency Lab",
      "certification_date": "2025-11-15",
            "verification_url": "12345"
    },
    {
      "trustmark_type": "tpi_r_score",
      "score": 87,
      "assessment_date": "2025-11-20",
            "report_url": "12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

**K.2.3 visual_trust_indicator Object**

```json

#### K.3 Global Privacy Rights Controls (GPRC)

**Deferred Rationale**: GPRC addressing 72 transparency contexts (3 vectors × 4 TATA levels × 6 legal bases) extends beyond v1.0’s base.

**K.3.1 GPRC Architecture**

Enables context-aware rights controls across all transparency contexts maintained through Notice Event Logs.

**K.3.2 global_privacy_rights_controls Array**

```json
{
  "global_privacy_rights_controls": [
    {
      "context_id": "consent_L2_regional",
      "data_control_vector": "co_regulation",

        "withdraw_consent": {
          "method": "notice_receipt_anchored",
          "mechanism": "Update Notice Event Log via rights_access_point",
          "authentication_required": false,
          "immediate_effect": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**K.3.3 Context-Specific Rights Exercise**

GPRC enables:

- Automated Rights APIs per context
- Preference-signal-triggered objection in legitimate interest contexts
- Notice-receipt-anchored withdrawal without authentication
- Regulatory verification of rights availability at scale

**K.3.4 72 Digital Transparency Control Contexts**

- 3 Data control vectors × 4 TATA levels × 6 legal bases = **72 contexts**.

**V1.1 Development Requirements**:

- Context-specific rights mapping across all 72 combinations
- API specification for automated rights exercise
- Integration with preference signals
- Regulatory oversight protocols
- Signalling
