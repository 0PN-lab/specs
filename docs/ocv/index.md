# OCV — Operational Constraint Vocabulary
**Supporting vocabulary for expressing operational constraints and interoperability rules**

## What this is
OCV provides vocabulary support for expressing constraints that matter operationally (for example: scope, context, applicability, and enforcement-oriented conditions) alongside the profile lineage.

## How it relates to this repo
OCV is a supporting component used to keep:
- profile requirements expressible in machine-consumable form
- constraints inspectable and testable
- implementations consistent across domains and jurisdictions
