# ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 (Base Standard)
**Privacy technologies — Consent record information structure**

## Start here
- ISO catalogue entry (public): https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html

## What this is
ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 specifies an interoperable, open, and extensible information structure for recording a PII principal’s consent to PII processing, including:
- provision of a record to the PII principal
- exchange of consent information between information systems
- lifecycle management of recorded consent

## How it relates to this repo
The 0PN Lab profile lineage in this repo extends ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 toward **Transparency-by-Default** infrastructure, including:
- **Controller-ID first** disclosure (before collection or inference)
- **Bilateral proof-of-notice** patterns (receipts held by both controller and individual)
- Consolidated “Digital Consent” packaging (DCR v1.2) built on UNR lineage

## Next (recommended reading path)
- DCR v1.2 (Digital Consent, consolidated): ../unr/dcr/v1.2/
- UNR v1.01 (baseline implementer reference): ../unr/v1.01/
