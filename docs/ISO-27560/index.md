# ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 (Base Standard)
**Privacy technologies — Consent record information structure**

## Start here 
- ISO catalogue entry (public): https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html

## What this standard provides
ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 specifies an interoperable, open, and extensible information structure for recording a PII principal’s consent to PII processing, supporting:
- provision of a record to the PII principal
- exchange of consent information between information systems
- management of the life cycle of the recorded consent

## How this repo extends it
The 0PN Lab profile lineage in this repository extends ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 toward **Transparency-by-Default** infrastructure by adding (at the profile layer):
- **Controller-ID first** disclosure before collection or inference
- **Bilateral proof-of-notice** patterns (receipts held by both controller and individual)
- A consolidated “Digital Consent” packaging (DCR v1.2) built on the UNR lineage

## Recommended reading path (this docs site)
