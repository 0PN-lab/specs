# Well-known location: `notice.txt`
**Controller disclosure entrypoint (Transparency-by-Default pattern)**

## What this page is
This page documents the well-known discovery pattern used to publish controller disclosure artefacts (for example a Controller Identification Record and related transparency metadata) at a predictable path on a controller domain.

## Why it matters
Well-known locations enable:
- automated discovery by individuals, regulators, and agents
- verification before collection (Controller-ID first ordering)
- consistent cross-controller interoperability without bespoke integrations

## Recommended references (repo lineage)
- UNR v1.01 baseline (best starting point): ../../unr/v1.01/
- DCR v1.2 consolidated packaging: ../../unr/dcr/v1.2/

## Status
This page is a documentation entrypoint. The canonical normative requirements live in the UNR / DCR profile documents referenced above.
