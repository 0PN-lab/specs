# 0PN Lab Specs 
Welcome to the 0PN Lab GitHub, focused on **Digital Public Transparency Infrastructure (DPTI)**. This repository supports implementing the **Convention 108+ Code of Conduct** through an extension profile that publishes the **0PN Lab ISO/IEC TS 27560 profile lineage** and the consolidated **“Digital Consent”** packaging, based on the ISO/IEC 27560 consent record information structure.

**How to use this site**
- If you want the **best overview**, start with DCR v1.2.
- If you want the **most stable implementer reference**, start with UNR v1.01.
- Treat v1.1 as a **working draft** unless you are participating in a pilot or review.
