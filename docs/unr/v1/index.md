## Foundation (base standard)
- ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 — Consent record information structure  
  https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html

## What this version is
UNR v1 establishes the initial profile layer that extends the ISO/IEC TS 27560 base structure into a **Transparency-by-Default** architecture, centered on:
- **Controller-ID first** disclosure (before collection or inference)
- **Bilateral notice receipts** (proof held by both controller and individual)
- A pathway toward **notice event logs** and progressive assurance levels
