## Foundation (base standard)
- ISO/IEC TS 27560:2023 — Consent record information structure  
  https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html

## What this version is
UNR v1.01 is the baseline profile reference that operationalises:
- **Controller-ID first** disclosure
- **Stage-based exchange** (Stage 1 notice receipt as the minimal base pattern)
- Bilateral proof-of-notice and auditability primitives that enable Code of Conduct style governance

## How to use this page
- If you are implementing or reviewing “UNR as prerequisite infrastructure,” use **v1.01** as the stable baseline.
- If you are evaluating enhancements, proceed to **v1.1** as a working draft.
- If you are using the consolidated packaging, proceed to **DCR v1.2**.
